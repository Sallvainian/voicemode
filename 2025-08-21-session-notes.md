# Session Notes - 2025-08-21

## End of Session Summary

### Accomplished Tasks

1. **Core ML Support for Whisper**
   - Updated whisper install to use CMake instead of Make
   - Automatically enables Core ML on Apple Silicon
   - Successfully generated Core ML models for base and large-v3-turbo
   - Achieved ~2.75x speedup (1337ms → 485ms encoding time)
   - Verified Core ML is active in production

2. **Enhanced Whisper Status Command**
   - Added version detection (v1.7.6)
   - Shows Core ML compilation status
   - Displays whether Core ML model is active
   - Reports GPU acceleration type (Metal/CUDA)
   - Created `whisper_version.py` helper utility

3. **Audio Conversion Optimization**
   - Implemented automatic detection of truly local whisper
   - Skips WAV→MP3 conversion for local whisper
   - Added timing measurements for conversion
   - Reduces STT processing significantly

4. **Fixed Whisper Model Management**
   - Fixed benchmark command (removed --no-prints flag)
   - Fixed model active command configuration updates
   - Fixed CLI import naming conflicts
   - Benchmark now shows accurate timing

5. **MCP Configuration**
   - Updated .mcp.json to use `uv run voicemode`
   - Removed hardcoded paths for portability
   - Works with local development version

### Remaining Tasks & Opportunities

1. **Auto-restart whisper when changing active model**
   - Currently requires manual restart
   - Could offer automatic restart option

2. **Core ML auto-generation in model install**
   - `whisper_model_install` tool doesn't auto-generate Core ML
   - Should detect Apple Silicon and build Core ML automatically

3. **Duplicate status commands cleanup**
   - Check if there's duplication between service status commands

4. **Further optimizations for local whisper**
   - Could explore using PCM format directly
   - Investigate streaming audio to whisper

### Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Emotional TTS support**
   - Already documented in converse tool
   - Uses OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini-tts model

2. **Better SSH-forwarding detection**
   - Current detection is good but could be enhanced
   - Consider adding explicit local/remote configuration

3. **Whisper model auto-selection**
   - Based on available memory and performance requirements
   - Could benchmark on first run and recommend optimal model

### Key Configuration Changes
- Whisper now builds with Core ML support on Apple Silicon
- Using large-v3-turbo model with Core ML acceleration
- Audio conversion skipped for local whisper
- Development setup uses editable install correctly

### Performance Improvements Achieved
- Whisper encoding: 1337ms → 485ms (2.75x faster with Core ML)
- STT total time: Reduced by avoiding WAV→MP3 conversion
- Overall voice interaction latency significantly improved

### Files Modified
- `.mcp.json` - Fixed for local development
- `voice_mode/cli.py` - Fixed model command imports
- `voice_mode/tools/converse.py` - Added audio optimization
- `voice_mode/tools/service.py` - Enhanced status display
- `voice_mode/tools/services/whisper/install.py` - CMake with Core ML
- `voice_mode/tools/services/whisper/models.py` - Fixed benchmark
- `voice_mode/utils/services/whisper_version.py` - New capability detection

### Git Commit
- Branch: `feature/whisper-alignment`
- Commit: `55928de feat: Add Core ML support and audio conversion optimization`
- CHANGELOG.md updated with all changes
