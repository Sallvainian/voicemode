# MCP Tools vs Raw Commands

## User's Question
What advantages would making a tool give versus using actual commands? I guess it could mean that it's a set of commands which are going to be effective and are well thought through instead of you having to think out how to do it each time. And another thing might be that the MCP server creator, people might have trust in them and they know that the source code is used and reviewed by other people. So that could give people confidence in approving it for use.

## Claude's Answer
Excellent points! You're right - dedicated MCP tools would provide consistency, safety, and trust. Instead of me crafting bash commands each time, the tools would have:

1. **Proper error handling** - Graceful failure modes and clear error messages
2. **State management** - Track if browser is already running, prevent duplicate instances
3. **Defined boundaries** - Users know exactly what the tool can and cannot do
4. **Code review** - Users can review the tool's source code once and approve it, rather than scrutinizing every command
5. **Better integration** - Handle port conflicts, provide clean status updates
6. **Consistency** - Same behavior every time, no variations in command syntax

It's the difference between ad-hoc scripting and a proper API.

## Key Insight
MCP tools provide a trusted, reviewable interface that users can approve once, rather than evaluating the safety of each individual command. This builds confidence and enables more complex automations.
