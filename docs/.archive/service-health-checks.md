# Service Health Checks and Updates

Voice Mode services now include health check functionality to ensure services are fully ready before reporting as started, and service file update capabilities to keep your service configurations current.

## How It Works

### systemd (Linux)

Services use `ExecStartPost` to check the `/health` endpoint:

```ini
ExecStartPost=/bin/sh -c 'while ! curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8880/health >/dev/null 2>&1; do echo "Waiting for Kokoro to be ready..."; sleep 1; done; echo "Kokoro is ready!"'
```

Benefits:
- `systemctl start` blocks until service is ready
- Clear status messages during startup
- Immediate feedback on success/failure

### launchd (macOS)

Services use wrapper scripts that perform health checks:

```bash
# Start service and wait for health endpoint
exec "./start-kokoro.sh" &
SERVICE_PID=$!

while ! curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8880/health >/dev/null 2>&1; do
    if ! kill -0 $SERVICE_PID 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "Service failed to start"
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "Waiting for service to be ready..."
    sleep 1
done
```

## Service Status During Startup

When you check service status during startup, you'll see:

**systemd:**
```
‚óè voicemode-kokoro.service - Voice Mode Kokoro Text-to-Speech Service
     Active: activating (start-post) since Mon 2025-01-28; 3s ago
    Process: 12345 ExecStart=/path/to/start.sh (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
    Process: 12346 ExecStartPost=/bin/sh -c while ! curl... (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 12345 (python)
     Status: "Waiting for Kokoro to be ready..."
```

**launchd:**
```
Service is starting... (check logs for details)
```

## Endpoints

Both Whisper and Kokoro services provide `/health` endpoints:

- **Whisper**: `http://127.0.0.1:2022/health`
- **Kokoro**: `http://127.0.0.1:8880/health`

These endpoints return 200 OK when the service is ready to handle requests.

## Service File Updates

Voice Mode tracks service file versions and can update them when improvements are available.

### Checking Version Status

```bash
# Check service status including version info
voice-mode service kokoro status
```

Output shows both application and service file versions:
```
‚úÖ Kokoro is running
   PID: 12345
   Port: 8880
   CPU: 2.3%
   Memory: 1024.5 MB
   Uptime: 1h 23m 45s
   Service files: v1.0.0 (v1.1.0 available)
   üí° Run 'service kokoro update-service-files' to update
```

### Updating Service Files

```bash
# Update service files to latest version
voice-mode service kokoro update-service-files
```

This will:
1. Backup existing service files
2. Apply the latest templates with your current configuration
3. Reload systemd/launchctl if needed
4. Preserve your service state (running/stopped)

### What Gets Updated

- **systemd**: Unit file with latest directives and health checks
- **launchd**: Property list and wrapper scripts

Service files use semantic versioning:
- **Major**: Breaking changes requiring manual intervention
- **Minor**: New features (like health checks)
- **Patch**: Bug fixes and improvements

## Troubleshooting

If a service fails to become ready:

1. Check service logs:
   - systemd: `journalctl --user -u voicemode-kokoro -f`
   - launchd: `tail -f ~/.voicemode/logs/kokoro/kokoro.log`

2. Manually test the health endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8880/health
   ```

3. Common issues:
   - Port already in use
   - Model files not found
   - Insufficient memory for model loading

### Update Issues

If service file update fails:
- Check for backup files: `~/.config/systemd/user/*.backup.*`
- Manually restore: `mv voicemode-kokoro.backup.1.0.0 voicemode-kokoro.service`
- Reload daemon: `systemctl --user daemon-reload`
