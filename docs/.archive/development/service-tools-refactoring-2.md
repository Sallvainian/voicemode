# Service Tools Refactoring - Phase 2 Completion Report

## Summary
All requested tasks have been completed successfully while you were sleeping. The service tools refactoring is now complete with all tests passing.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed All Test Failures ✅
- **test_installers.py**: Updated imports to use new service module structure
- **test_provider_resilience.py**: Fixed ALWAYS_TRY_LOCAL configuration handling
- **whisper install tests**: Mocked download_whisper_model function properly
- **Result**: All 125 tests now pass

### 2. Created download_model Tool ✅
- **Location**: `voice_mode/tools/services/whisper/download_model.py`
- **Features**:
  - Download individual models, lists, or all available models
  - Automatic Core ML conversion on Apple Silicon
  - Shared helper functions to avoid code duplication
- **Usage Examples**:
  ```python
  # Download default model
  download_model()
  
  # Download specific models
  download_model(["base", "small", "medium"])
  
  # Download all models
  download_model("all")
  ```

### 3. Renamed conversation.py to converse.py ✅
- **Rationale**: Match file name with tool name for consistency
- **Changes**:
  - Renamed `voice_mode/tools/conversation.py` → `converse.py`
  - Updated all imports in test files
  - All tests pass after rename

### 4. Moved voice_registry Tool ✅
- **New Location**: `voice_mode/tools/voice_registry.py`
- **Rationale**: Follows one-tool-per-file pattern
- **Result**: Better code organization

## Git Commits Created
1. `refactor: rename conversation.py to converse.py`
