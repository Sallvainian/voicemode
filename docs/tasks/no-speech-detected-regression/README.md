# No Speech Detected Regression

## Overview
Fix critical regression on `feature/conversation-browser-library-broken` branch where user audio is recorded and saved but always results in "No speech detected" despite working TTS.

## Status
üü° **INVESTIGATED** - Root cause identified but not fixed

## Goals
1. ‚úÖ Identify root cause of "No speech detected" issue
2. ‚úÖ Understand goals behind changes in the broken branch
3. ‚ùå Fix the regression while preserving intended functionality
4. ‚úÖ Document findings and solution

## Investigation Notes

### Symptoms
- User audio is being recorded
- Audio files are saved
- STT service is available and working
- But always returns "No speech detected"

### Next Steps
1. Compare branches to identify changes
2. Examine STT processing code
3. Check audio format/encoding issues
4. Test with saved audio files
5. Write tests to prevent future regressions

## Investigation Summary

The regression is caused by the refactoring that moved MCP instance from `server.py` to `mcp_instance.py` in commit b8efb9f.

### Key Findings:
- Recording and STT work correctly when tested directly
- Only fails when called through MCP tool interface
- Issue is related to stdio handling in MCP context affecting audio recording

### Attempted Fixes (Unsuccessful):
1. VAD downsampling fix - not the issue
2. Audio silence threshold fix - not the issue

### Root Cause:
MCP servers use stdio for communication, which interferes with audio recording when imports were restructured.
