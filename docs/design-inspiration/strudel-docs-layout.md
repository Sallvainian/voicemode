# Strudel Docs Layout - Design Inspiration for Voice Mode

Website: https://strudel.cc/

## Key Design Elements to Consider

### Landing Page Structure
- Clean, focused landing page with immediate "Getting Started" path
- Workshop-based learning approach rather than traditional documentation
- Interactive REPL embedded directly in the site for immediate experimentation

### Navigation Hierarchy
- Clear separation between:
  - Workshop (tutorial/learning path)
  - Documentation (reference)
  - Showcase (examples)
  - Blog (updates/community)
- Progressive disclosure - starts simple, reveals complexity as needed

### Interactive Elements
- Live code editor integrated into documentation
- "Try it now" approach with immediate feedback
- Examples that can be modified and run in-place

### Learning Path
- Structured workshop approach:
  1. Getting Started
  2. First Sounds
  3. Progressive complexity
- Low barrier to entry - "no prior experience needed" messaging
- Multiple entry points for different skill levels

### Community Integration
- Clear community links (Discord, Mastodon)
- Showcase section for user creations
- Blog for updates and tutorials

## Recommendations for Voice Mode Docs

1. **Interactive Demo First**: Like Strudel's REPL, consider an immediate "try voice mode" demo
2. **Workshop Approach**: Structure docs as progressive tutorials rather than reference-only
3. **Clear Learning Path**: Define beginner → intermediate → advanced paths
4. **Live Examples**: Embedded audio/voice examples where possible
5. **Community Showcase**: Section for user-created voice mode applications/uses
6. **Simplified Navigation**: Focus on core paths: Getting Started, Workshop, Reference, Community

## Technical Notes
- Strudel is built as a JavaScript port of Tidal Cycles
- Web-first approach makes it highly accessible
- Documentation is open-source on Codeberg
