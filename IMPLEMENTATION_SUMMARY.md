# Core ML Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented ✅

### 1. Core ML Download Function
**File**: `voice_mode/utils/services/whisper_helpers.py`
- ✅ Added `download_coreml_model()` - Downloads pre-built models from HuggingFace
- ✅ Modified `download_whisper_model()` to use pre-built models on Apple Silicon
- ✅ Deprecated `convert_to_coreml()` for backward compatibility
- ✅ Removed dependency on `coreml_setup.py`

### 2. MCP Tool Updates
**File**: `voice_mode/tools/whisper/model_install.py`
- ✅ Removed `install_torch` parameter completely
- ✅ Removed `_handle_coreml_dependencies()` function
- ✅ Removed all PyTorch/coremltools installation code
- ✅ Updated status messages for pre-built models

### 3. Platform Detection
- ✅ Checks `platform.system() == "Darwin"` and `platform.machine() == "arm64"`
- ✅ Only attempts Core ML download on Apple Silicon
- ✅ Falls back to Metal acceleration if Core ML unavailable

### 4. Testing
- ✅ Successfully tested download of Core ML model
- ✅ Verified file structure and extraction
- ✅ Confirmed 15.7MB download for tiny model

## What Still Needs Work ⚠️

### 1. Whisper Install Default Model
**File**: `voice_mode/tools/whisper/install.py`
- ❌ Does NOT currently install a default model
- ❌ Needs `--model` and `--no-model` flags added
- Current: Just installs whisper.cpp binary
- Needed: Should install base model by default

### 2. Documentation Updates
- ❌ Remove references to Xcode requirements
- ❌ Remove references to PyTorch installation
- ❌ Update README with new simplified process

### 3. Potential Homebrew Integration
**Discovery**: Official `brew install whisper-cpp` exists!
- Could potentially use Homebrew formula instead of building
- Includes Metal acceleration support
- Would eliminate compilation entirely
- Consider for Phase 2 improvement

## Architecture Note

Both CLI and MCP tools use the same underlying functions:
- `whisper_model_install` (MCP tool) → calls `download_whisper_model`
- CLI commands → also call `download_whisper_model`
- This ensures consistent behavior across interfaces

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1b**: Update `whisper_install` to include default model
2. **Phase 2**: Consider using Homebrew whisper-cpp formula
3. **Phase 3**: Clean up legacy code and documentation
4. **Phase 4**: Remove coreml_setup.py entirely

## Performance Impact

- Pre-built Core ML models: 2-3x faster than Metal
- No build time required (instant vs minutes)
- No 2.5GB PyTorch dependency
- No Xcode installation required
- Works on all Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3/M4)
