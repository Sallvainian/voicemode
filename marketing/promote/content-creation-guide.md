# Voice-MCP Content Creation Guide

## 1. Priority #1: Demo Screencast Video

### Video Specifications
- **Length**: 3-5 minutes maximum
- **Resolution**: 1080p minimum
- **Audio**: Clear, professional quality
- **Format**: MP4 for broad compatibility
- **Subtitles**: Include for accessibility

### Suggested Script & Flow

#### Opening (0:00-0:30)
```
"Hi! I'm going to show you voice-mode - a complete voice interaction server 
that lets you have real-time voice conversations with Claude and other LLMs.

In the next 4 minutes, I'll show you:
- 30-second installation
- Voice conversation with Claude
- Local vs cloud TTS comparison
- LiveKit room demonstration

Let's get started!"
```

#### Section 1: Installation (0:30-1:00)
**Screen**: Terminal/command prompt
```bash
# Show empty terminal
$ uvx voice-mode

# Show installation progress
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Show Claude Code integration
$ claude mcp add --scope user voice-mode uvx voice-mode
```

**Narration**:
"Installation is just one command with uvx. Add your OpenAI API key, 
then integrate with Claude Code. That's it - voice-mode is ready!"

#### Section 2: First Voice Conversation (1:00-2:15)
**Screen**: Claude Code interface
```
User types: "Can you ask me a question using voice?"
Claude uses voice-mode tool
Shows voice conversation happening
```

**Narration**:
"Now let's have a voice conversation. I'll ask Claude to speak to me...
[Show actual voice interaction]
Notice how natural the conversation flows - speech-to-text picks up my response,
and Claude responds with natural-sounding voice."

#### Section 3: Local vs Cloud Demo (2:15-3:15)
**Screen**: Split showing config changes
```bash
# Show cloud config (default)
echo "Using OpenAI TTS/STT"

# Show local config
export STT_BASE_URL="http://localhost:2022/v1"
export TTS_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8880/v1"
export TTS_VOICE="af_sky"
```

**Narration**:
"Voice-mcp supports both cloud and local services. Here's the same conversation
using local Whisper STT and Kokoro TTS. Notice the different voice quality
and the privacy benefit of keeping everything local."

#### Section 4: LiveKit Room Demo (3:15-4:00)
**Screen**: LiveKit room interface + voice-mode
```
Show room with participants
Demonstrate voice-mode connecting
Show real-time conversation in room
```

**Narration**:
"For multi-user scenarios, voice-mode integrates with LiveKit rooms.
It automatically detects active rooms and joins the conversation.
Perfect for collaborative AI sessions or voice-enabled meetings."

#### Closing (4:00-4:30)
**Screen**: GitHub repo, README
```
Show github.com/mbailey/voice-mode
Show installation instructions
Show star button
```

**Narration**:
"Voice-mcp is open source and easy to extend. Check out the GitHub repo
for more examples, configuration options, and integration guides.
Thanks for watching!"

### Technical Setup Tips

#### Screen Recording Setup
1. **Resolution**: Record at 1920x1080
2. **Frame Rate**: 30fps minimum
3. **Audio**: Use external microphone, not system audio
4. **Window Management**: Clean desktop, close unnecessary apps
5. **Terminal**: Use large, readable font (14pt+)

#### Audio Recording
1. **Microphone**: Use USB or XLR microphone if available
2. **Environment**: Quiet room, minimal echo
3. **Levels**: Record with headroom, normalize in post
4. **Script**: Practice beforehand to minimize "ums" and pauses

#### Post-Production
1. **Editing**: Basic cuts, remove long pauses
2. **Titles**: Add section titles/overlays
3. **Captions**: Generate and review auto-captions
4. **Export**: H.264, high quality settings

### Distribution Strategy

#### Primary Platforms
1. **YouTube**: Upload as unlisted first for testing
2. **GitHub**: Embed in README.md
3. **Twitter**: Post as native video for autoplay
4. **Reddit**: Upload directly to platform

#### Video Hosting
- **Primary**: YouTube (for embeds and SEO)
- **Backup**: GitHub releases (for direct downloads)
- **Social**: Native uploads for each platform

üßµ Just launched voice-mode - the missing piece for voice AI workflows

1/7 Ever wanted to have actual conversations with Claude? Not just typing back and forth, but real voice conversations?

That's exactly what voice-mode does. Here's how it works üëá

2/7 Installation is literally one command:
`uvx voice-mode`

Add your OpenAI key, and you're talking to Claude in under a minute.

[Demo GIF]

3/7 But here's what makes it special:
‚úÖ Works with local OR cloud TTS/STT
‚úÖ LiveKit integration for multi-user rooms  
‚úÖ Built for the Model Context Protocol
‚úÖ OpenAI-compatible (works with any provider)

4/7 Want privacy? Use local Whisper + Kokoro TTS:

```bash
export STT_BASE_URL="http://localhost:2022/v1"
export TTS_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8880/v1"
```

All processing stays on your machine.

5/7 Building team workflows? LiveKit integration means multiple people can have voice conversations with AI in real-time rooms.
