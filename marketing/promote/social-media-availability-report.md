### Primary Brand: "voice-mode" (hyphenated)
**Rationale:**
- Already established on PyPI
- More availability across platforms
- Distinguishes from Voicemod (voice changer)
- Professional appearance

### Consistent Naming Strategy:
- **Package names**: voice-mode (PyPI, npm)
- **Social handles**: @voice_mode or @voicemode where possible
- **Domain**: voice-mode.com
- **Display name**: "VoiceMode" (stylized)

### Fallback Options:
- @voicemode_mcp
- @getvoicemode
- @voicemode_official
- @voicemode_ai

## Competitive Landscape

**Voicemod** (voice changer software) dominates "voicemode" namespace:
- Large established brand
- 11k+ Instagram followers
- Active on Twitter, TikTok, Discord
- Risk of brand confusion

**Recommendation**: Embrace the hyphenated "voice-mode" brand to differentiate.
