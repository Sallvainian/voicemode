## What if you could just... talk to Claude?

Imagine explaining a bug out loud and hearing Claude walk you through the fix. Or having a back-and-forth design discussion while you code. Voice Mode makes Claude Code feel like pair programming with a real person.

**In 30 seconds:** Install Voice Mode and say "Hey Claude, let's debug this together" - and actually have a conversation.

## üé¨ See It In Action

Watch Voice Mode transform how you work with Claude Code:

## Why Voice Mode Changes Everything

### Before Voice Mode üòî
- Type long explanations of bugs
- Copy-paste error messages back and forth
- Lose context switching between docs and code
- Feel isolated debugging alone
- Wait for responses without knowing if Claude understood

### After Voice Mode üöÄ
- "Claude, this function is throwing an error" *paste* "What's wrong?"
- "Walk me through this architecture while I look at the code"
- "Let's brainstorm a better approach" (actual back-and-forth!)
- Feels like pair programming with a senior developer
- Natural conversation flow - Claude waits for your response

## What Users Say

<summary>‚öôÔ∏è Advanced configuration</summary>

### Use Local Services (Free & Private)
```bash
# Voice Mode can install these for you:
export STT_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:2022/v1"  # Local Whisper
export TTS_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8880/v1"  # Local Kokoro
```

### Custom Voices
```bash
export TTS_VOICE="nova"  # OpenAI voices
# Or create ~/voices.txt with your preferences
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
export VOICEMODE_DEBUG="true"
export VOICEMODE_SAVE_AUDIO="true"  # Save recordings
```

See [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md) for all options.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>üêõ Common issues</summary>

- **No microphone access**: Check terminal has mic permissions in System Settings
- **API error**: Verify your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- **WSL2 audio**: See [WSL2 Microphone Guide](docs/troubleshooting/wsl2-microphone-access.md)

Run diagnostics:
```bash
python scripts/diagnose-audio.py
```
